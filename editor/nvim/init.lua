-- 1. `:help startup`
-- 2. `:help lazy.nvim-üöÄ-usage-‚ñ∂Ô∏è-startup-sequence`
-- for the implications of doing this.
-- lazy.nvim takes over the Neovim startup sequence.
--
-- Normally, the vimrc (this file) is sourced during Step 7 of startup and
-- plugins would be loaded in Step 10. But by calling our bootstrap/config
-- script for lazy.nvim, which in turn calls the `setup` function from the
-- lazy.nvim lua module, we will distrupt the remainder of the normal
-- startup process.
--
-- lazy.nvim basically sets `vim.go.loadplugins` to false which disables
-- Step 10 entirely. Instead, lazy.nvim will then mimic the things that
-- Neovim would normally do.
--
-- This is why we can't just stick the bootstrap/config script in `plugin/`.
-- It's because lazy.nvim needs to take over the process. Otherwise, what
-- happens is that Neovim will load all plugins which will load lazy.nvim
-- which will then try to load all plugins which will result in lazy.nvim
-- trying to load itself and then we get into an infinite loop (which is
-- broken by a check performed in lazy.nvim, but this results in a warning
-- message during startup).
